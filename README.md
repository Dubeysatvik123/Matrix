# Math Problem Solver with LangChain

## Overview

This project is a math problem solver that utilizes LangChain and LLMs (Large Language Models) to tackle a wide range of mathematical problems. The solution is built using the Gemme2 framework and leverages the capabilities of advanced language models to provide accurate and detailed solutions. The frontend is implemented using Streamlit for an interactive user experience. This uses Google Gemma2 for getting solution for maths problem

## Features

- **Comprehensive Math Problem Solving:** Handles various types of math problems.
- **Step-by-Step Solutions:** Provides detailed explanations for each solution.
- **LangChain Integration:** Uses LangChain to manage and interact with LLMs efficiently.
- **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly web interface for easy interaction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/math-problem-solver.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd math-problem-solver
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install Streamlit:**

    If Streamlit is not included in your `requirements.txt`, install it separately:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit App:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This will start the Streamlit server and open the app in your web browser.

2. **Using the App:**

    - Enter your math problem in the provided input field.
    - Click on the "Solve" button to get the solution and detailed explanation.

3. **Example:**

    In the Streamlit interface, you might input: `"What is the integral of x^2?"` and receive the solution along with a step-by-step explanation.
